// * ES6 CLASS INTRODUCTION

// The concept of "class" in JavaScript was introduced in ES6.
// Internally, a class is a "wrapper" over the normal way JavaScript works.

// A class still gives you an efficient way of creating "types" of object, and "giving" them default properties and methods.

// Class syntax is more comparable to similar features available in C#, Java etc.
